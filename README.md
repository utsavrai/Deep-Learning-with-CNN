# Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks
The following repository explores the underlying concepts of efficient Deep Learning principles applied over CNN.

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that delves into the fundamentals and applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in deep learning. It is designed to provide a hands-on approach to understanding how CNNs can be used for image recognition tasks.

## Overview

The "DL_CNN" notebook explores the following key topics:
- Basics of CNN architecture
- Implementing CNNs using popular deep learning libraries
- Training CNNs on image datasets - ImageNet: NaturalImageNet
- Evaluating model performance - ResNet-18
- Hyperparameter Optimisation strategy using Baysian Optimisation - Optuna
- Application examples of CNNs in real-world scenarios

## Installation

To run the notebook, you will need Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. Additionally, the notebook requires the following Python libraries:
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:


```
pip install jupyterlab numpy matplotlib torch torchvision
```

## Usage

To start Jupyter Lab and open the notebook, run:

```
jupyter lab DL_CNN.ipynb
```

Or, for Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook DL_CNN.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions within the notebook to explore different CNN models and their applications.
